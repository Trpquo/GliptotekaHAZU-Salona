<h1 class="hidden">Cult of Silvanus</h1>
<p>
    Shrines of Silvanus or Silvan are often to be found in a landscape close to some spring of fresh water, where the shepherds looking after their flocks could rest or take refuge. They indicate the development of the cult and a religious life that was closely connected with the economic features of the Delmati people in the surroundings of Salona. Reliefs with a depiction of Silvan as patron of flocks and shepherds are often carved into the bedrock or else tend to be small relief votive monuments. Through <em>interpretatio graeca</em> Silvanus took on some of the iconographic characteristics of the Greek Pan, and the epigraphic monuments recorded his name that, through the process of <em>interpretatio romana</em>, was taken from the Italic deity Silvanus. Thus Pan-Silvanus is a syncretic cult deity. The cult of Silvanus was often united with the cult of the Nymphs to whom water and springs were dedicated.

    Caves of the Nymphs with many springs, from which such abundance of water trickles down this winding slope ; and you, echoing shrine of Pan crowned with pine-leaves, the home that is his at the foot of the woodland rock

<blockquote>
    A short distance from the farm there was a rock, its top shaded by laurels and plane trees. On either side of it were bushes of myrtle, and ivy ran around it somehow from the top, clinging closely to the stone; from it clear water dripped. Under the projecting edges of the rock some statues of Nymphs were set up and a Pan peeped out as though he was spying on the Naiads.
