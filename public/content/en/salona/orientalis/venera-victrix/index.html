<h1 class="hidden">Venera victrix</h1>
<p>
    In the NE part of the city, to the west of Porta Andetria, E. Dyggve uncovered a tetrastyle temple from the time of Diocletian, in the immediate vicinity of which a statue of Venus Victrix was found. The statue of the goddess, symbol of the total victory and prosperity of the Roman Empire was probably set up in a cella of this, the last non-Christian, temple in Salona.
