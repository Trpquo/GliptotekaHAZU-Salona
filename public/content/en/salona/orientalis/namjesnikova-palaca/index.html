<h1 class="hidden">Governorâ€™s palace</h1>
<p>
    In the eastern part of the city, alongside the old Roman bridge, below which flowed the main channel of the river, was the palace of the governor of the province.

    A city villa of the classical type with a central atrium surrounded with porticoes and a series of rooms, it was probably built in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century and considerably renovated during the time of Diocletian. The best-known Salona mosaics, with depictions of Orpheus, Apollo and Triton, graced the floors of the palace, in addition to others in the main ceremonial hall with motifs of intertwined plants. Over the main entrance, in the direction of the decumanus that led into the centre of the city, is the relief of Tyche Salonitana, as well as a relief depicting Roma, the patroness of the Roman state.
