<h1 class="hidden">A boy at play with his pet</h1>
<p>
    The Salona sculpture of a boy playing with his pet is a version of one of the favourite motifs of Hellenistic art known to us largely from Roman copies. A particular interest in these motifs of Hellenist art appears again in Roman times, in the Flavian and the late Antonine periods. The marble sculpture was probably, in view of the context of the find, a votive gift to the Temple. The stylistic properties of the artistic details on the boyâ€™s head, and the drill-defined pupils, familiar novelties employed since the Hadrian period, like the shaping of the hair with a drill, which appeared in the period of the Antonines, help in the dating of the sculpture.

    Apart from that, the marble statue of the boy was found together with coffered panels of the temple ceiling with rhomboid motifs decorated with acanthus leaves that can be dated to the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century.
