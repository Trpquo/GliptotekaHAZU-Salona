<h1 class="hidden">The great city baths or thermae</h1>
<p>
    East of the cathedral, and partially below it, were the big city thermae. The entry through the vestibule led into an open courtyard (<em>palestra</em>) surrounded with a portico with an impluvium in the centre. A series of rooms of different purposes ran around the central part. In the north was a larger room with apse and cold water pool (<em>frigidarum</em>) and off to the west were two rooms for disrobing (<em>apodyterium</em>). In the NE corner was a room with a bath (<em>tepidarium</em>) connected with the hot bath and the steam room for sweating (<em>sudatorium</em>), the walls of which were lined with hollow bricks (<em>tubuli</em>); the floor was placed on a series of little stacks that enabled a stream of hot air from the nearby furnace (<em>formax</em>). Here too were individual baths as well as masonry built benches for visitors. The thermae buildings also stretched on the western side of the street, below the episcopal complex, where a mosaic has been discovered that depicts the poet Sappho surrounded by the Muses, still there in situ, and known only from a drawing.
