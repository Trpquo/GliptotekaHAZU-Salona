<h1 class="hidden">Porta andetria</h1>
<p>
    On the defensive walls, new city gates were put up, like those on the eastern side called Porta Andetria, recently fully excavated, whence led important routes to the interior of the province. The gate was defended by four towers reinforced with triangular avants corps, deployed before and behind the interior defensive court or propugnaculum.

    In the paving of Porta Andetria a fragment of a public inscription was discovered; originally displayed over the gate, it describes in detail the works on the reconstruction of the city walls and towers during the reigns of Theodosius II and Valentinian III (5<sup>th</sup> century). A twin of the inscription was also placed on the postern gate, the so-called Porta suburbia II.

    The ara of Titus Flavius Lucilius was found as spolia incorporated into the first tower to the south of Porta Andetria. It was erected to his patron by the freedman Titus Flavius Eulogus. It lists the cursus honorum of Lucilius. From the duties of centurion of cohortis VIII Voluntariorum he was recruited into the imperial guard of equites singularium Augusti  in Rome (2<sup>nd</sup> century).
