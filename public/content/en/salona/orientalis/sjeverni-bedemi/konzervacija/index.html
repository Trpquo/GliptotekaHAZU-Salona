<h1 class="hidden">Conservation works on the northern defensive walls</h1>
<p>
    The new fortifications around the eastern and western suburbs were built by the troops under the supervision of their commanders, as recorded in the still existing inscriptions of the outer curtain of the northern walls. The locally stationed First and Second Delmat Cohorts erected DCCC feet of wall (236.80 m) and the cavalry squads of Legio II Pius and Legio III Concordia especially detached from other provinces for the sake of these construction works, CC feet (59.20 m) of walls.
