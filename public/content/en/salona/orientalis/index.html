<h1 class="hidden">Urbs Orientalis</h1>

<p>
    The new eastern part of the city or Urbs orientalis occupied a considerable space toward the mouth of the River Salon occupied today by the city of Solin. The immediate vicinity of the delta meant that the city’s tissue was intersected by channels of the river, such as the main flow that entered through the eastern walls and ran through the middle of the city all the way to the stone Roman bridge (Five Bridges, as it is named), creating the backbone of the urban grid. Recent archaeological research has defined its eastern course and a wooden bridge placed on four huge stone bases alongside which the embankments of the course of the river were found as well as a drainage channel for the sake of regulating the water level.

    Used here were numerous fragments of monumental ancient buildings as spolia – architraves, marble capitals, massive lintels, a plinth for a statue of Empress Aurelia Prisca, parts of a coffered ceiling, votive marble sculpture and an altar to Jupiter. This involved a temple dedicated to the supreme Roman god raised in the main square, the forum, in the very centre of the Urbs orientalis during the formation of this part of the city and renovated during the time of Diocletian.

    In the NE part of the city, to the west of Porta Andetria, E. Dyggve uncovered a tetrastyle temple from the time of Diocletian, in the immediate vicinity of which a statue of Venus Victrix was found. The statue of the goddess, symbol of the total victory and prosperity of the Roman Empire was probably set up in a cella of this, the last non-Christian, temple in Salona.
