<h1 class="hidden">Urbs occidentalis</h1>
<p>
    At the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (170) when the first pressures of the barbarians at the borders of the Roman Empire were being felt, the extensive suburbs on the west and eastern sides of the original core of the city were protected by the erection of new city walls into which a monumental amphitheatre was incorporated. Discovered here was part of the ancient road to Trogir, paved with large stone slabs, a considerable part of which remained within the Urbs occidentalis. Found on the southern side are the remains of the foundations of heavy walls of the grave plots (<em>murazzo</em>) of the western cemetery, which ran along the road. The murazzo wall was used in the construction of the city gate (Porta occidentalis), abutted by the northern tract of the city defensive walls.
