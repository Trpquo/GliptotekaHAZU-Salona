<h1 class="hidden">Amphitheatre</h1>
<p>
    The amphitheatre that earlier ran along the periphery of the city was involved in the construction of the western defensive walls. In the north west part, its external curtain articulated with a series of arched entrances was removed, and defensive walls stretched alongside the radial walls of the substructures of the auditorium, closing it in like a corner bastion.

    The amphitheatre had three storeys, the lower two of which were articulated with arches between which there were half-columns with Doric or Ionian capitals, and a third course had smaller square openings. Three interior corridors created the system of the substructure of the auditorium (<em>cavea</em>), which comprised two meniana and a gallery at the top. Since the northern menianus in the lower part abutted the slope of the hill, it had no vomitorium, and the radial walls of the substructure were necessary only for the upper floor, that is the southern side, of the auditorium, built on flat land. The amphitheatre, dimensioned 125 x 102 m (the arena was 60 x 40 m) could hold, in Dyggveâ€™s computation, about 16,000 to 17,000 spectators. From the interior corridor that surrounded the arena (<em>via venatorum</em>) went the access to the two small shrines of the gladiators dedicated to the goddess Nemesis.

    Later, in the Early Christian age, the shrines were turned into oratories of the Salona martyrs who had suffered in the arena during the persecutions of Diocletian. The walls of the oratories are decorated with frescoes showing the martyrs marked with their names; on the days of their martyrdoms there were memorial processions The amphitheatre had a rectangular space beneath the arena (Porta Libitinae) from which on the south an underground corridor led outside the building to the gladiator quarters, which was hard by. Here at first there had been a cemetery, where several gladiator urns were unearthed, from the inscriptions of which we learn of their names, their homelands and their specialities. This is a neglected part of the western Salona cemetery.
