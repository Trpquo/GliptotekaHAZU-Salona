<h1 class="hidden">Episcopal complex</h1>
<p>
    The Salona metropolitans dedicated themselves to the arrangement of their seat, created alongside the first Christian oratories in the NW corner of Urbs orientalis. Salona Cathedral was built by Bishop Sympherius and Bishop Hesychius, as written in the mosaic inscription of the ambulatory. Sympherius began the majestic work and it was completed by his nephew Hesychius <em>cum clero et populo</em> and dedicated to Christ. This is the biggest Early Christian building of Roman Dalmatia, and was formed in the early 5<sup>th</sup> century. The exceptionally well decorated three-nave basilica was ornamented with frescoes and the floor surfaces were covered with mosaics. As pointed out in the dedicatory epigraph of the cathedral <em>Nova post vetera</em>, not only did the Salona metropolitan finish the building of the cathedral but completely spiritually renewed the Early Christian Church and ecclesiastical conditions in his province. In the mood of Justinian’s <em>reconquista</em>, the last building operations of the episcopal complex were undertaken. The very able archbishop Honorius erected on the site of the earlier three-nave basilica a majestic cross-shaped church. At that time the old cathedral was remodelled, and alongside it was a baptistery complex with the new buildings of baptistery and consignatorium, where at the entry there was an allegorical illustration of Psalm 41 (42), which was sung by the catechumens gazing with the ardour of a deer at the spring of the divine water: <em>Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes aquarum ita desederat anima mea ad te Deus</em> [As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God].. All was connected together by the elongated narthex at the western side of which stretched the episcopy, the bishop’s residence, with festive hall and spacious atrium that gave access onto a small thermal complex. The centre of the bishopric was in the true sense of the words, as Dyggve picturesquely put it, “a little city of the church”.
