<h1 class="hidden">Marusinac</h1>
<p>
    The complicated cemeterial complex at Marusinac where the second episcopal graveyard was formed is the most distant from the city and contains a number of monumental buildings. The southern three-nave basilica with narthex and atrium surrounded by cisterns was decorated with floor mosaics with geometrical ornamentation shot through with Christian symbolism. Here on her own plot of land the matron Asclepia built a mausoleum for the martyr Anastasius, a dyer from Aquileia, who, having come to Salona, was martyred during the persecutions of Diocletian (on August 26, 304). On the northern side there is an open courtyard and a particular cult building in the shape of a three-nave basilica with open central nave, or <em>basilica discoperta</em> or <em>ecclesia sine tecto</em>, where there are the graves of Salona bishops and other dignitaries of the church; in fact it is an oratory or martyry.
