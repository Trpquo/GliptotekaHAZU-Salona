<h1 class="hidden">Kapljuč</h1>
<p>
    By the northern city walls, in one of the oldest Salona cemeteries, Kapljuč, where the Salona martyrs were buried – the priest Asterius and the four soldiers of Diocletian’s guard – Antiochanus, Gaianus, Telius and Paulinianus, in the middle of the 4<sup>th</sup> century, an Early Christian basilica was built. This is a three-nave building with an entry to the south, facing onto the approach from the city. Here led a road alongside which numerous funerary monuments were placed, like a cluster of 16 sarcophagi, running alongside the walls. By its internal modelling the three-nave space of the church was divided into two parts. The eastern part was divided by masonry built square pillars into three naves, while in the western part the central nave was separated from the side walls. The difference in the purpose of the individual spaces is emphasised by the manner in which the main nave is decorated. In the front part floor mosaics are made of a votive, funerary or decorative character; in the western part it is paved with stone flags. In the Early Middle Ages the church was reduced to the central space  and walls were  put up between the pillars in the eastern part of the church, a new altar  being installed.
