<h1 class="hidden">Manastirine</h1>
<p>
    The best known Early Christian cemetery was formed at Manastirine, where the Salona bishops and martyrs were buried, like Domnius, first bishop of the church in Salona. Over their graves, initially placed in an oratory, Bishop Gaianus erected a monumental three-nave basilica with transept. The building started at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> century and, taking his cue from Bishop Ambrose, of Milan, during his lifetime he placed his own sarcophagus under the altar right next to the sarcophagus of the martyr Septimius. Next in this central space came the sarcophagi of Sympherius and Hesychius, builders of the cathedral of Salona, and other worthy Christians in the immediate vicinity of the martyrsâ€™ graves. In the 6<sup>th</sup> century the narthex was added on and the space of the chancel was remodelled with a new altar screen and a solemn approach (<em>schola cantorum</em>). When Salona fell in the middle of the 7<sup>th</sup> century, the demolished basilica was renewed only in the space of the transept, i.e., of the original oratory.
