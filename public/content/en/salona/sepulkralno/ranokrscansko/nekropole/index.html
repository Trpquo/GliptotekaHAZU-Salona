<h1 class="hidden">Early-christian cemeteries</h1>
<p>
    Outside the city, right alongside the walls where the approach roads ran, the Salona cemeteries were created. Here the Salona martyrs were buried, and later over their graves the cemeterial basilicas of Kapljuč, Manastirine and Marusinac were built.
