<h1 class="hidden">Sarcophagus with a depiction of the centauromachy</h1>
<p>
    The rear side of an Attic sarcophagus is today incorporated into the staircase of the Renaissance-Baroque De Caris (later Geremia ZlendiÄ‡) Palace in Split, end of the 2nd and early 3rd century. The sarcophagus features the motif of the centauromachy from Greek mythology showing the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapiths, one of the few examples of this theme in Dalmatia. According to Greek myth, the centaurs were fantastic creatures, part horses, part men. At the wedding of the king of the Lapiths, Pirithous, drunken centaurs attempted the rape of his bride Hippodamia and other Lapith women. A fierce fight ensued and the centaurs were beaten, just a few of them saving the lives by fleeing. This fight symbolises the victory of the Greeks over the barbarians. The theme of the central relief depiction of the centauromachy on the Salona sarcophagus consists of two centaurs that in a dynamic composition are each fighting two Lapith men.
