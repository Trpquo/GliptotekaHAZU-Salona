<h1 class="hidden">Sarcophagus featuring the myth of hunt for the kalydonian boar</h1>
<p>
    A sarcophagus showing the myth of the hunt for the Kalydonian boar is the most important extant Attic sarcophagus on the Adriatic coast of the second quarter of the 3rd century. ON the front the mythical scene is presented, the moment when Meleager, son of the king of Calydon in Aetolia, with the help of the virgin huntress Atalanta, attacks and kills the Calydonian boar. The sarcophagus was in front of the baptistery of Split Cathedral, where it was noticed by the travel writer Cyriac of Ancona in 1436; since 1886 it has been kept in the Archaeological Museum in Split.

    Local tradition long had it that this was the sarcophagus of Diocletian, after a legend, as well as because of an inscription on it that mentions his wife, Prisca. According to legend, Diocletian, when he was still a simple soldier, on one occasion had to pay for dinner and when he gave just the right money to the tavern keeper, a certain Draiada, she said he could have put in a coin or two more. Diocletian said he would be more open handed when he became emperor. She warned him not to play with fate for he would ascend the throne only after he killed the destined Boar. Diocletian understood this literally and he constantly went hunting for boar, hoping that he would kill precisely the boar of his destiny.
