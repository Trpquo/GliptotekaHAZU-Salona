<h1 class="hidden">Antque sarcophagi</h1>
<p>
    During the 2<sup>nd</sup> century with a change in the manner of burial (inhumation) the continued production of local limestone sarcophagi began, with fewer that were made of Proconnesian marble. Imported blocks or semi-products of Proconneisan marble were finished in the workshops of Salona, as shown by the example of the sarcophagus of Homonea Zosima, with the typical motifs that had earlier been used on sepulchral altars. A symbol of the constant renewal of life is expressed in the personification of the seasons.

    The age of the soldier emperors was the time of the greatest importation of Attic sarcophagi in Dalmatia. Found at Manastirine was a sarcophagus with a depiction of cupids hunting, dated to about 230, and one of the highest quality reliefs of the time and type. In the continuous relief frieze there are cupids hunting game, a common motif in sepulchral art.
