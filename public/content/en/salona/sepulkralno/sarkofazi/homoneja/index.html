<h1 class="hidden">Sarcophagus of Homoneia Zosima</h1>
<p>
    During the 2nd century with a change in the manner of burial (inhumation) the continued production of local limestone sarcophagi began, with fewer that were made of Proconnesian marble. Imported blocks or semi-products of Proconneisan marble were finished in the workshops of Salona, as shown by the example of the sarcophagus of Homonea Zosima, with the typical motifs that had earlier been used on sepulchral altars. A symbol of the constant renewal of life is expressed in the personification of the seasons.
