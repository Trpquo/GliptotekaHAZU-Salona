<h1 class="hidden">Stela</h1>
<p>
    Roman sepulchral art and the practice of putting up funerary stelas from the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> or the beginning of the 1<sup>st</sup> century BC was formed on the principles of Greek and Hellenistic art. The oldest examples of stela have forms that have associations with temple architecture, tapering to the top and ending in a moulded triangular pediment.

    The type of stela with figures of a married couple of the 1<sup>st</sup> century was made of local limestone and shows that the local Salona workshops were able to fulfil complex commissions and in terms of excellence of workmanship could keep up with the quality and high level of Italic workshops.
