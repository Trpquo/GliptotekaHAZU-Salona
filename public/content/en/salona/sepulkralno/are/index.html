<h1 class="hidden">Aras</h1>
<p>
    During the first half of the 1<sup>st</sup> century a new type of monument, the ara, (altar) was introduced. Best known is the ara of Pomponia Vera (1<sup>st</sup> century) from the western cemetery, where it was secondarily used as building material and built into the western city defensive wall of Salona.
