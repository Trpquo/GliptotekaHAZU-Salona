<h1 class="hidden">MARTIA IVLIA VALERIA SALONA FELIX</h1>
<p>
    Salona, the capital city of the Roman province of Dalmatia, was formed in the central part of the eastern coast of the Adriatic, at the head of a protected bay, alongside the mouth of a river at the foot of the mountain massif of Kozjak. The Delmati, who inhabited the surrounding hill forts, very early on exploited the favourable position of the port, and it also attracted the attention of the Issaean Greeks, who developed an emporium essential for their commerce with the interior. At this node of trading routes, at the time of the Roman conquest of the area of Dalmatia a city was formed &mdash; <em>Colonia Martia Iulia Salona</em>.

    When the Archaeological Museum was founded in Split, archaeological excavations of Salona also began. At this time the first plans on which were drawn the segments of the city visible at that time were produced (by Vicko AndriÄ‡ and Carlo Lanza). The systematic research of Frano Carrara (1846-1849) ascertained the full perimeter of the city. Even today his ground plan is the basis for the presentation of the look of the ancient metropolis, and was adopted by Ejnar Dyggve, who established the development of the city, and on whose analysis the understanding of the urbanism of Salona is based.
