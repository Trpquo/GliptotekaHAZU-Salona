<h1 class="hidden">Theatre and temple</h1>
<p>
    The forum complex was divided by the cardo from the monumental building of the theatre. The construction of the semicircular auditorium, resting in the lower part on the natural slope of the land and of the substructures in the upper, finished at the top with a gallery and portico. Opposite the seats for the spectators is a rectangular stage building, the façade of which was articulated and richly ornamented (<em>scaenae frons</em>), meant for the actors, as well as the dais of the theatre raised from the semicircular orchestra. In the rear was a big corridor linked with the porticoes placed at the side, used for the gathering of the visitors before and after the performances.

    In front of the theatre were the temples; that put up earlier was a tetrastyle edifice with a façade adjusted to the theatre corridor and linked with it by lateral porticoes. A cult building with a simple cella in which there was a statue of a deity was probably dedicated to Dionysius or perhaps Liber, since it was in the immediate vicinity of the theatre.
