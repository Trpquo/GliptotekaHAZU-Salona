    An until recently lost marble sculpture with satyrs that since 1857 has been in a private collection in Graz was discovered in Salona in the 19th century. This is probably a Roman copy of some well-known artwork done in the Hellenistic style. Although we have unfortunately no information about the circumstances of the discovery, the common fate of two Salona sculptures that were probably bought at the same time and then ended up in a private collection in Graz is highly suggestive.

    Since a marble torso of an emperor that found its way into a private collection in company with the group of satyrs was unearthed in the immediate vicinity of the Salona forum, it is possible that the satyrs come from the same part of the city. The first archaeological excavations of the early 19th century were at the baths complex to the north of the forum and at the theatre located on the western side, in the vicinity of which lay the temple of Dionysus or Liber. The poignant group of three young satyrs cruelly squeezed in the deadly embrace of the huge snake was probably of a cult nature. The satyrs are connected with Dionysus, they are his followers, condemned to the torture of being constricted by the giant reptile, which is probably a personification of the deity. The dramatic anxiety aroused by the depiction of divine punishment is a theme often treated of in tragedies. The Greek satyr play with which a trilogy was usually concluded was closely connected with the Dionysian cult. Euripides connected the satyrs with selected mythic material in the added satyr plays where he usually made the satyrs the slaves of some monster and in this manner cowardice and cunning were expressed in a rather extreme comedy. In the Hellenistic period the satyr play was revived, as was the popularity of Euripidean themes. The Salona sculpture is a perfect representation of this play.
