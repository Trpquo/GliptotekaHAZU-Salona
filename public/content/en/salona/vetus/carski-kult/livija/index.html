<h1 class="hidden">Portrait of Empress Livia (?)</h1>

<p>
    Livia Drusilla (59/59 BC â€“ AD 29) was the wife of Emperor Augustus, who adopted her son Tiberius. After the death of Augustus, she wanted to retain her influence, and it is thought that she killed him, in the desire to ensure the throne for her son Tiberius, Allegedly she smeared poison on the figs that Augustus was wont to pick in his garden. She wanted to be co-ruler with her son Tiberius and become an independent empress, controlling all his political moves. In AD 42 Claudius deified Livia, and from then on she was revered as the Divine Livia, special priests being charged with her cult.

    A female portrait with classical features; it has very regular features and is idealised. The hair is combed with a central parting, and wavy locks, with deep channels, are tied in a bun at the back. Notwithstanding the idealised features, similarities in some details of the physiognomy with known depictions of Livia can be seen. In the lower part, the head is conically placed, as is characteristic of imperial sculptures.

    The portrait is a fine piece of work with precisely made details and chased, confirming the high quality of production.

    This sculpture was found in Salona between 1820 and 1825 by the Chapel of St Doimus, south west of Manastirine, together with a nude male figure, of an emperor (?).

    At the bottom of the neck the head of the empress ended in a wedge, and during restoration headed by the archaeologist A Conze in Vienna, an erroneous assumption led  to it being fitted into the male body of an emperor. Recently the awkward restoration was corrected and the head was separated from the body.
