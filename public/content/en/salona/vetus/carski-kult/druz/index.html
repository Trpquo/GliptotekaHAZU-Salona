<h1 class="hidden">Portrait of Drusus Caesar</h1>

<p>
    Drusus Caesar (Drusus Julius Caesar, AD 7&mdash;33), son of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder; his brothers were Nero and Gaius (the future emperor, Caligula), and his sisters were Julia Livilla, Julia Drusilla and Agrippina the Younger.

    He was a Roman aristocrat and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (31 BC&mdash;AD 68) and a close relative of all five emperors of the dynasty. His great grandfather Augustus was the first emperor of the dynasty, his uncle Tiberius the second, his brother Gaius (Caligula) was the third, his uncle Claudius the fourth, and his nephew Lucius Domitius (better known as Nero) was the fifth and last emperor of the dynasty.

    After the death of his father Germanicus and Tiberiius’ son Drusus the Younger, the Emperor Tiberius in the year 23 adopted Germanicus’ sons (Nero Julius Caesar and Drusus Caesar) and they became pretenders to the throne. After the death of his brother Nero Caesar (accused of conspiracy against the emperor, exiled to an island and forced to commit suicide), Drusus Caesar became the pretender first in line for the throne but he was arrested for treason and starved to death. He died of starvation in prison in AD 33, endeavouring to eat the stuffing of his bed (Tacitus, Annals, 6.23).

    This depiction fits in with the propaganda device of erecting sculptures in an attempt to popularise potential heirs to the throne, an important element of state stability.

    The head of a boy is carved in white marble with a light brown patina, suggesting an import. The boy is shown with markedly individualised features, chubby cheeks and thin lips, a regular nose, relatively large eyes with emphatically incised lids and eyebrows. His hair style is similar to the Augustine hairstyle that appears in imperial portraits of what are called Prima Porta type with the characteristic detail on the forehead of this hairstyle type what is called the “swallow tail” and “pincer”. It is thought that it belonged to the same group of imperial statues as the portrait of the boy Nero Caesar. It is not known where exactly in Salona it was found.
