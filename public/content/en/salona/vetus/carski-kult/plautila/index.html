<h1 class="hiddden">Portrait of Empress Plautilla (?)</h1>

<p>
    Fulvia Plautilla or simply Plautilla (about 185 or about 188/189 to 211) was the wife of Roman emperor Caracalla, her second cousin on the paternal side.
</p>
<p>
    She was born in and grew up in Rome, and belonged to the clan of the Fulvians, of plebeian origin from Tusculum in Italy, active in politics from the Roman Republic.
</p>
<p>
    Her father was Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, commander of the Praetorian Guard , consul, first cousin on the fatherâ€™s side and close ally of Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (father of Caracalla). Severus and Plautianus arranged the marriage of Plautilla and Caracalla. This forced marriage turned out poorly, with Caracalla despising Plautilla and at the end exiling her to Sicily and Lipari. It is assumed that after the death of Septimius Severus in 211, at the orders of Caracalla she was strangled and that he ordered all memory of her to be erased (<em>damnatio memoriae</em>).

    The female portrait known as Salona or Solin woman is a youthful depiction of Empress Plautilla.
</p>
<p>
    The portrait is modelled with pronounced softness and refinement as well as perfect precision in the details. The hairstyle is divided into twelve segments in the Melonen type, collected on the nape and braided into a bun. The presentation is idealised and dignified, emphasising her confidence, beauty and pride. According to remains and traces of pigment on the original, it can be seen that the sculpture made a striking colourist impression and had the exceptional quality of the art of portraiture of the Severan period.
