<h1 class="hidden">The imperial cult</h1>
<p>
    The beginnings of the imperial cult in Salona go back to the time of Augustus when two small temples were built on the forum of the oldest part of the city – Urbs vetus. There are many sporadic finds of the emperors or members of imperial families or dedicatory epigraphs on the bases of their statues and the buildings put up in their honour. The continuous development of the imperial cult can be seen down to the period of the tetrarchs, as confirmed by new research in the eastern part of the city or Urbs orientalis where on the main city square there was the temple of Jupiter, renovated in the time of Diocletian. It was actually on the forums that the imperial cult, associated with the official cult of Rome, was developed as expression of state policy. The cult was influenced by the East, where adoration of the king as deity was entrenched and quite usual.

    After the apotheosis of Augustus in the year 14 the Senate proclaimed the veneration of Augustus official, and it was through the imperial cult that the loyalty and devotion of the provinces to Roman policy were expressed. Probably on the Salona forum there would have been a set of imperial statues, i.e. of Augustus and his family, the elements of which are just coming into view. A marble female head, probably of Livia, and a monumental sculpture of a toga-clad figure the head of which has unfortunately not survived, are attributed to the Salona imperial cult. From Salona come portraits of members of the imperial family, the boys Nero and Drusus Caesar, Augustus’ descendants, and a statue of a prince of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

    A monumental epigraph of Empress Faustina (CIL III 14243), today in the Archaeological Museum in Split, was once incorporated into the bell tower of Split Cathedral. The base of the empress’s sculpture was probably originally placed in the shrine of the imperial cult in Salona during the rule of Marcus Aurelius, who was to be credited not only with the erection of new defensive walls but also with the considerable renovation of the capital of the province of Dalmatia.

    The best known Salona sculptures are the portraits of Empress Plautilla – two marble portraits in two versions with different hairstyles, both confirmed by the depictions of Plautilla on coins. Although this is to date the only extant example of a sculpture of the Severus dynasty, clearly the tradition of the veneration of the emperors and the members of their families in temples built for the purpose of propaganda and the imperial cult continued. The last period in which it is possible to trace the imperial cult in Salona is that of the tetrarchs. A plinth recently found in the very centre of Salona belonged to a sculptural portrait of Empress Prisca, wife of Diocletian.
