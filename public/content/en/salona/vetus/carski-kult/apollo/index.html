    This sculpture was found in pieces in Split, and the head even in Solin. It is a shame that not even an accurate description of the finding site is left for us, or a precise list of the number and sizes of the individual pieces. It was bought for our museum and then lay here in pieces for some time, after which it was sent to Vienna, where it was repaired by the sculptor König.

    Just as then the comparison of the measurements arouses a doubt in us as to whether the upper part of the body from a smaller statue was just not just added on, so the measurements and the anatomically impossible shape of the leg is a reason for us to be unsure whether or not here various pieces have been put together into an incongruous whole.

    Apart from the head, the statue breaks down into three pieces. Each of these pieces has a special feature: the uppermost a cloak; the central,  archaic style vine tendrils; and the bottommost laurel leaves on a stump. The measurements do not fit, the characteristics do not fit, the manner of the musculature does not fit, and the marbles of the bottommost piece and the top pieces do not fit, and in addition to all this the individual parts are so well made that we cannot even adduce ignorance on the part of the sculptor, rather we have to raise the doubt expressed to the level of statement that this statue has been patched together from several statues. 
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    It is impossible, unfortunately, to gather any longer how much the sculptor [König] has patched and changed the pieces sent.
</p>

    From what we have said so far, we opine then that the statue of our Apollo consists of four pieces, to wit: one female head, one piece from a sculpture of probably Hermes, and two different statues, which perhaps both presented Apollo, which however I would not be sure of, for it is also possible that the pieces are of some ephebe or perhaps a portrait statue, which in the later Roman period were made in the manner of and with the attributes of the gods.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    Our figure stands completely ambiguously, the mobility of the legs and the resting of the body on the legs are not expressed in the body, in the way they should be from the position of the legs.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    It is not then any kind of wonder or impossibility that from the pieces of four Roman sculptures it is possible to work and put together a single one, particularly when into the bargain one does not look at the disharmonies and mistakes of the kind there are in our statue.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    If as for the head we knew that the other pieces were not found together, the answer would be simpler and more likely, and would go: that our statue has been made in the modern age of four different statues.

    The statue was exhibited in the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, where it was damaged in the earthquake of March 2020 and fell into separate pieces; this is then a chance to consider Kršnjavi’s remarks during the new restoration of the sculpture.
