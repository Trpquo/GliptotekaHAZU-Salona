<h1 class="hidden">Urbs vetus</h1>
<p>
    The <em>Urbs vetus</em>, as Dyggve called the oldest urban nucleus of Salona was protected with huge defensive walls that enclosed the trapezoid shape of the city. Uniquely preserved is the NE corner of the city walls reinforced with a rectangular tower and the imposing city gate (<em>Porta Caesarea</em>) flanked with octagonal towers and equipped with a propugnaculum, or inner defensive court. On the upper floor over the central passage meant for wheeled traffic and the side entrances for foot passengers was a pass articulated with arched apertures provided with architectural decoration and a dedicatory epigraph to Emperor Augustus.

    In the southern part of the city stretched the main square, of a rectangular shape, the Forum with the usual contents known just in their basic elements. Two tetrastyle temples were built symmetrically on the northern side, and between them was a square stand, used as a platform for addressing the citizens. The whole of the square was, according to the reconstruction of Dyggve, framed with porticoes that because of the closeness of the port was opened up with a series of arched arcades, on the southern side too, where there were the substructures of cellar storerooms. In this place, or so D. Rendić-Miočević hypothesises, there was the city basilica. On the eastern side of the forum, the city council chamber or curia was discovered and on the northern side, a luxuriously appointed baths complex (<em>balnea</em>).

    A view of the city at the time Trajan was putting in to the port of Salona, in which a scene of sacrifice was unfolding, is a recognisable segment of the relief of Trajan’s Column, from the mentioned public buildings of the forum complex and the theatre shown in the background.
