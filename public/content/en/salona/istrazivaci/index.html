<h1 class="hidden">Istraživači salone u 19. stoljeću</h1>
<p>
    At the beginning of the 19th century the first organised excavations of Salona began, and the Archaeological Museum was founded in Split. The first protection of monuments laws shaped the foundations of archaeological scholarship. At the forefront of research and scholarship in Salona were Ivan Luka Garagnin (1764-1841), Carlo Lanza (1781-1834), the first director of the Archaeological Museum of Split, Vicko Solitro and Rafo Martini. Josip Čobranić was the first to put through the Austrian protection of monuments statute in 1816, and Vicko Andrić (1793-1865) did the first accurate survey of the whole area of Salona, in 1821. Then Francesco Carrara (1812-1854) started the first systematic topographic researches. Šime Ljubić (1822-1896), Francesco Lanza (1808-1892), Mihovil Glavinić (1833-1898) all had a hand in important excavations and discoveries. Don Frane Bulić (1846-1934) started extensive researches into the Early Christian sites, while Ejnar Dyggve (1877-1961), on account of his exceptional work devoted to the urban development of Salona and individual complexes with monumental buildings had the honorary citizenship of Solin conferred upon him, becoming <em>Civis salonitanus</em>.
