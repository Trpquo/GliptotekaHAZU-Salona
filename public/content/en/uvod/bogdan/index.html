<p class="bio"> 
Žižić graduated at the Law Faculty of Zagreb University. He worked in Zagreb Film as dramaturge from 1960 to 1964 and director from 1984 to 1990. From 1964 he was engaged in film direction, making his name as one of the leading Croatian short films directors, for which he won international prizes. His acted films, with elements of surrealism were <em>Madeleine, mon amour!</em>, 1971; <em>Joke</em>, 1973; <em>Last Race</em>, 1975; In his documentary films, two important themes can be perceived – recent Croatian history and personal testimonies – <em>Jasenovac</em>, 1966; <em>Goli otok</em>, 1994; <em>Damnatio memoriae or an assault on memory</em>, 2000; <em>A Vukovar Story</em>, 2002; <em>Vlado Gotovac – My case</em>, 2008; <em>Jasenovac Memento</em>, 2016, – and the other is fine art and the life of artists – <em>Expressionism in Croatian Painting</em>, 1985; <em>Emanuel Vidović</em>, 1989; <em>Celestin Medović</em>, 1991; <em>Alfred Pal</em>, 1993; <em>Vlado Bukovac</em>, 1994; <em>Dear Vincent</em>, 2006; <em>Leo Junek – painter with two homelands</em>, 2009; <em>Miroslav Kraljević</em>, 2014. His best achievements were in films with no dialogue or accompanying narration, both acted (<em>Journey</em>, 1972; <em>Press</em>, 1981, jury prize at the Oberhausen Festival) and documentary (<em>Praise to the hand</em>, 1968; <em>Morning of a pure body</em>, 1969; <em>The Gastarbeiter (Dragutin Trumbetaš)</em>, 1977; <em>Fairground</em>, 1982; <em>One Life</em>, 1985). His feature films are <em>House</em> (1975) and <em>Don’t lean out</em> (1977), both awarded the Grand Gold Arena at the Pula Feature Film Festival, making his name as a leading representative of the trend for socially critical treatments in the Croatian movies in the 1970s. Two other films belong to the same thematic group: <em>Give what you give</em> (1979) and <em>Early Snow in Munich</em>, 1984, his most successful feature film occupied with the generation gap in a family of émigrés in Germany. A not so well received feature film, <em>Price of a Life</em> (1994) is thematically connected with the Homeland War. For television he produced the acted films <em>Quartet</em> (1997, after Milan Begović) and <em>House of Ghosts</em> (1998, after Ksaver Šandor Gjalski), as well as many documentaries about cultural history, especially that of Split and Dalmatia (Along the <em>Ruins of Salona</em> I-II, 2004; <em>Palace of the Sun</em>, 2005; <em>Josip Slade, builder</em>, 2007; <em>A Second Venice</em>, 2010; <em>A century of cinematography in Split</em>, 2011; <em>Along the Cetina River to Trilj</em>, 2011; <em>Ejnar Dyggve – Citizen of Solin</em>, 2016).
