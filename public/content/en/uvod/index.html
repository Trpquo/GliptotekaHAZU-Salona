    The exhibition in the Glyptotheque of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts shows Antique Salona, capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, Croatia’s most outstanding archaeological site, along with its several-centuries of continuous life in the city. Salona is shown through the historical development discovered during archaeological excavations that brought to the light of day individual urban units and monumental buildings, the emphasis being placed on the sculptural heritage from the holdings of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Glyptotheque. It is actually the sculpture of Salona that is represented the most abundantly in the Collection of Plaster Casts of Ancient Monuments of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts; it takes in public and sepulchral sculpture and a wealth of archival records. Shown is the history of the collection of Salona monuments in private collections, the first investigators of this ancient capital city, the known city units, the most significant edifices and the individual monuments, all of it accompanied with visual depictions.

    The exhibition is marking the occasion of the second centenary of the exploration of this very important antique site, in, what is more, the Year of Marko Marulić, the father of Croatian literature, who, in accord with the sprit of the humanist trends of the time, provided the first description of Salona epigraphic monuments, among which there is mention of the name of the Roman city of Salona. In this context we would cite Marulić’s opinion about the state of the monuments of Salona addressed to his friend Dmino Papaplić with whom he would frequently tour the ruins of the city: 
</p>
<blockquote>
    Previously, my dear Dmino Papalić, I have interpreted other people’s monuments to you, and now we shall explain those of our forebears: I have often looked at them, wandering with you around the desolate stone ruins of Salona, scattered all around, and have, thinking sometimes about how great the fame of our paternal soil was, with a sigh, recalled those words of Virgil: “Once there were Trojans, and Ilium, and the great glory of Troy” and now – nothing.<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>
