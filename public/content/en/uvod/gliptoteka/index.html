<p>
    The collection of plaster casts of ancient sculpture of the Glyptotheque of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts contains major works of Greek and Roman sculpture collected at the end of the 19th century; in addition, throughout the 20th century casts of sculptures from the area of Illyria and the Roman province of Dalmatia were collected.

    The collection began to be put together by Dr Izidor Kršnjavi in 1892, his intention being to found a Plaster Cast Museum; he put together an imposing collection of representative examples of ancient Greek sculpture from the Archaic age to the Roman period, in just a few years. The main problem was lack of space, and for various reasons the collection was located in inappropriate and interim premises, and was often moved; the collection was broken up, the items were damaged and have been in large part destroyed up to this time. The plaster casts of ancient sculpture were brought together in 1940 and housed in the <em>“Gipsotheca” Museum</em> (today the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Glyptotheque), on the initiative of the museum’s founder, Dr Antun Bauer. The museum organised its own workshop and for a number of years its experts toured the sites and took impressions and made moulds in situ, afterwards casting the sculptures in plaster. The antique stone sculpting was cast mostly from the holdings of the archaeological museums, the collection of the Glyptotheque thus being expanded and supplemented.

    The specific feature of a museum of castings is important for some of the monuments that are to be found in situ at their locations or which are parts of architecture, temples, parts of city fortifications, of public and sepulchral masonry that would otherwise never be placed in a museum collection. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Glyptotheque, the only institution for this kind of monument (plaster casts) in Croatia enables the correlation and exhibition, in ‘life’ size, in a single place, of artistic works from different collections, at great distances from each other and of different provenances.
