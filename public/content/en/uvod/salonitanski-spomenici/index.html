<h1 class="hidden">Collections of Salona monuments from the 15<sup>th</sup> to the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century</h1>

<p>
    Antiquarian interest in and the formation of collections containing Salona monuments started more than five centuries ago. The first descriptions of the collecting of materials and the formation of a private collection were given by the “father of Croatian literature” Marko Marulić (1450-1524) who with his friend Dmino Papalić created the fine Papalić Collection (Museum Papalinum). Archbishop Pacificus Bizza (1695-1756) also collected his own private set of ancient epigraphs, copies of which were published in the work Illyricum sacrum of 1751 by Francisco A. Zaccaria. Standing out among the antiquarians at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries were the Garagnin family from Trogir and Baron Francesco Maria Carnea von Steffaneo (1751-1825), imperial representative in Istria, Dalmatia and Albania, who took several Salona monuments to his estate in Tapogliano. Marquis Tommaseo degli Obizzi (1750-1805) acquired artworks for the collection of his family palace of Catajo, which later on (1922-1923) was acquired by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In the 19th century, particularly significant are the ample and highly prestigious private collections with Salona monuments of the physician Carlo Lanza (1781-1834) and Vicko (Vincenzo) Solitro (1782-1852). A part of the Solitro collection was purchased for the Archaeology Museum in Zagreb by Šime Ljubić in 1869 and a smaller part for the Archaeological Museum in Split. The private collection of Ivan Grubić known as Jablan (1773-1846) was bought for the Coins and Antiquities Cabinet (Münz- und Antiken Kabinett) of the court of Vienna, today housed also in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
